This privacy policy applies to the **Kreator Frame Dashboard** application (hereinafter, the “Application”), developed by **Luis Donaldo Gamas Vazquez** (hereinafter, the “Service Provider”). The Application is an open source dashboard that allows content creators to share Android widgets compatible with the Kustom Maker applications (KWLP and KWGT).

This policy describes how information collected from users is handled and how that information is protected. The Application is provided as is, without modification by users.

#### Information Collection and Use

Currently, the Application **does not** collect precise information about the location of your mobile device. However, in future updates, the Service Provider may begin collecting location data to enhance the App's features, such as content personalization and recommendations. These changes will be notified in this policy prior to implementation.

The Application stores certain information **locally** on your device for authentication purposes and to enhance your user experience. This information includes, but is not limited to:

* Email address
* Name
* Username, initially generated from the name provided, but which the user may change at a later date.

This information is not shared with third parties or stored on external servers. All data processing and storage occurs on your device.

#### Tracking and Advertising Services

The Application **does not use cookies** or tracking services at this time. There are also no advertising platforms used within the Application. 

The Service Provider intends to keep the Application free of advertising as long as **donations** are sufficient to sustain development. If after one year no donation support is received, consideration will be given to include advertising in the project. In that event, this privacy policy will be updated to reflect any relevant changes.

#### Third Party Access

Currently, no data is shared with third party services. Should additional services be integrated in the future, an update to this policy will be provided detailing what information is collected and how it is used.

#### Right to opt-out

You may stop using the Application at any time by uninstalling it from your device. To uninstall the Application, use the standard methods provided by your mobile device.

Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13. Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. In the event that Service Provider discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information, it will immediately delete such information from its servers. If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact Service Provider (luisgamas00@gmail.com) so that Service Provider can take appropriate action.
