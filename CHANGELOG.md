The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [v1.5.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Material You dynamic color (Material Design 3) support with `dynamic_color` package integration.
- Dynamic color option as first item in color theme selector with spectrum gradient visualization.

### Changed
- Color theme selector now displays theme-adaptive color previews: colors adjust brightness/saturation based on current light/dark mode for proper contrast.
- Refactored color theme selector grid: dynamic color option (index 0) with SweepGradient, accent colors shifted to indices 1+.
- `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` now generates per-color display variants matching current app brightness in real-time.

### Technical Details
- Added `isDynamicColor` field to `AppValuesPreferencesState` with index `-1` storage convention.
- New `setPreferenceForDynamicColor()` method in `AppValuesPreferencesNotifier`.
- Added static `buildFromColorScheme()` method to `AppTheme` for Material You support.
- Wrapped `MaterialApp.router` with `DynamicColorBuilder` in `main.dart` with fallback to seed color for unsupported devices.

### Notes
- Dynamic Color support requires Android 12+ and is fully supported on Pixel devices; Samsung and other OEMs may have limited support due to custom color palette implementations.

## [v1.5.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- New `ErrorView` reusable widget for displaying error states in async operations with optional retry button and customizable styling. Integrated across all screens using `AsyncValue.when()` for consistent error handling.
- Native Android wallpaper picker service via `WallpaperManager.getCropAndSetWallpaperIntent()`, allowing system UI selection of home screen, lock screen, or both. Implemented with `FileProvider` for secure content URI sharing.
- `WallpapersNativeServices` Kotlin class with clean separation of concerns: custom wallpaper application (download → crop → apply) and native picker integration (download → expose via FileProvider → system intent).
- New `_NativePickerButton` widget in WallpaperPreviewScreen providing alternative wallpaper application via native Android system UI.
- Wallpaper location constants in `Environment` class: `wallpaperHomeScreen` (1), `wallpaperLockScreen` (2), `wallpaperBothScreens` (3).
- New method `openNativeWallpaperPicker(String url)` across all data/repository layers (datasource → repository → UI).
- Localization strings for native picker option: `bottomWallSelectorNative` (English: "Use Android Wallpaper Picker", Spanish: "Usar selector nativo de Android").

### Fixed
- Completed the Riverpod 2.x → 3.x library migration by upgrading `flutter_riverpod` to `3.2.1` (previously only API patterns were updated, but the library remained on `2.6.1`).
- Replaced `FamilyAsyncNotifier<T, Arg>` (removed in Riverpod 3.x) with standard `AsyncNotifier<T>` using constructor-based argument injection for the `WidgetsNotifier` family provider.
- Replaced `AsyncValue.valueOrNull` (removed in Riverpod 3.x) with `AsyncValue.value` in `AboutPackageAppScreen`.

### Changed
- Migrated wallpaper application from third-party `flutter_wallpaper_manager` (0.0.4) to native Android implementation via Kotlin MethodChannel (`kreator_frame/wallpaper`). Image download, center-crop, and scaling now execute on background threads via `Thread` + `Handler` pattern, eliminating main thread blocking.
- Removed `Size size` parameter from `setWallpaper()` method across all layers (datasource → repository → UI). Screen dimensions now obtained natively via Android's `Resources.getSystem().displayMetrics`.
- Refactored error handling in HomeScreen, LicensesScreen, KustomWidgetsScreen, WallpapersScreen, and WallpaperPreviewScreen to use the new centralized `ErrorView` widget, eliminating code duplication.
- Replaced `flutter_staggered_grid_view` library with native `GridView.builder` using `mainAxisExtent` for precise cell height control. Refactored `CustomCardPreviews` to be constraint-responsive: removed `heightPreview` parameter, enabled image section to expand with `Expanded`, allowing parent grid to fully control sizing.
- Updated `KustomWidgetConfig` to use `cellHeight` (total grid cell height including image, text, and margins) instead of separate `previewHeight`, improving separation of concerns. Updated calculations: KWGT = 262dp (200 image + 62 overhead), KLWP = 352dp (290 image + 62 overhead).
- Updated multiple dependency versions to latest compatible releases: `archive`, `device_info_plus`, `dio`, `flutter_dotenv`, `flutter_markdown_plus`, `flutter_native_splash`, `go_router`, `image`, `shared_preferences`.
- Removed unused `flutter_cache_manager` direct dependency and corrected asset references in `Environment` constants.

### Removed
- `flutter_wallpaper_manager` (0.0.4) - functionality completely replaced with native Kotlin implementation.
- `flutter_staggered_grid_view` (0.7.0) - functionality replicated using native Flutter GridView.
- Unused Dart image processing methods: removed `_cropAndSaveImage()`, `dart:ui` codec operations, and `path_provider` dependency from datasource layer (moved to native Kotlin).
