Kreator Frame Dashboard is a Flutter-based project created to share your widget and wallpaper packs compatible with Kustom Apps (KWGT & KWLP) and share them on the Play Store.

This project is open source and ***still in beta phase***, possible bugs can be found but it means that they can be solved with proper identification of them.

I have developed Kreator Frame Dashboard solo, with a lot of effort and dedication, for all who wish to utilize it, provided they respect the rights established in the project's license. ***Users are welcome to contribute to its development, fostering a collaborative environment while upholding the rights outlined in the project's license.***
